# Drone_scenes_with_Yolo
Object detection on Drone Imagery with deep learning.Training and Inferencing the Yolov5 
Model training done on the Google Colab.The goal of the project: recognize target objects and mark them by bounding box 2D(BB). This project is based on drone view object detection. The training dataset also collected images taken by drones. NOTE that, the dataset was collected using various platforms (i.e from open source datasets, frame extraction), in different scenarios, and under various weather and lighting conditions, background images were also included. 
Detection classes: car, van, truck, bus, person
